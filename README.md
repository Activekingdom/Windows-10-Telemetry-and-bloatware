Get Rid of Windows 10 Telemetry and bloatware (work in progress)
I have added and  modify on to windows10debloter by Sycnex
There was a lot of work that has when it to this. A lot of changes have been made.
I tried to add a feature where it would verify the hash of the file. This feature will need more work. It works, but if you enter the Path, Algorithm, wrong the file will not be verified. And will continue making changes. I need to add a loop that will force the file to be verified. And ask you about the terms and conditions. I am not responsible for anything or reliable. You take full responsibility when running this script.
when you run the script you will need to give it admin perms. It will ask about the path where the
the file is the source file that is where the file is. Next, it will ask you what Algorithm to choose from the list. Like SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, or MD5. Then it will ask you to copy and past the Algorithm hash from here. Don't include like "SHA256:_" only long hash no spaces.
